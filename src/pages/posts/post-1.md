Welcome to my _personal_ blog. Here, I will share my thoughts, projects, and things I find interesting. It will be (mostly) written in english and I will (mostly) talk about things in tech.

## Stack

1. **Astro**: This is a Javascript framework to create content-driven websites. Component rendering is done server-side. This may look like a bad idea for a website hosted on a Raspberry Pi, but since I'm not hosting a lot of things in it and the blog will consist of static content, the specs of the Raspberry Pi are more than enough.

2. **Apache HTTP Server**: Realiable, simple, and I already know how to use it. Nginx also checks those boxes, but I find it easier to set up virtual hosts on Apache HTTP than on Nginx. 

3. **Raspberry Pi 4 model B**: I bought this one two years ago, when I was living in Buenos Aires. Since it's small enough I decided to take it with me when I started travelling.

## What's next

I will decide on a layout, then test some styles. Once I settle with the layout and style of the website, I'll start adding new posts.
